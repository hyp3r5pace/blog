<p>2020 was definetly a weird year. It was totally different, not just for me but for many people. The year started with a family trip to Singapore. It was lot of fun and exciting. It was just my parents and me who went to Singapore. I wished my brother also came along, it would have been more fun for sure. Singapore clearly blew away my mind. It is now one of the top places I want to live in future if possible. There are many reasons why I loved Singapore soo much. First,i it is a multi cultural place. This means that unlike various other places which consist of only people of one culture and nation, Singapore is totally different from that. Singapore primarily consist of people of three cultures- Chinese, Tamil and Malay. But besides these, people from different nations also reside in Singapore. I have seen plenty of Europeans and Americans during my visit and it surely made the country more diverse and vibrant. Also, Singapore is the first fully developed nation I visited. The scale and level of modernization is something I have never seen before, and that is something that made me love Singapore a lot more. Singapore is a small country but that didn&apos;t dissapoint me at all. During my three day visit, I have visited a lot of places and I am pretty sure, I missed many others which I will try to visit in future. The food in Singapore is amazing. I tried some of the most unique and delicious dishes of my life. I guess it is the benefit of being a multi cultural place. One gets to try different foods very often. All in all, it was a awesome trip and a memorable one. One important thing to note is that COVID 19 pandemic was still in it&apos;s early stages now. It was still not declared a pandemic yet. But during my visit to Singapore, some outbreaks of COVID 19 already happened there, especially around Chinatown. The night before the day when were supposed to visit Chinatown, I saw on news that such outbreaks of COVID 19 has happened and thus we cancelled our plan to visit Chinatown. Lucky us!</p>
<p>After the trip, midterms came along and I got busy in my midterm exams. Midterms went shitty for me, mostly becuase I now lived in a two bedded room, and sharing a small room with someone is not something I am accustomed with. I liked living alone in a single room but this sudden sharing of room with someone felt more like a intrusion of my privacy which always made me feel very anxious. I was not a single bit comfortable and always very anxious. I don&apos;t know how people do that? This clearly affected my studies as I couldn&apos;t concentrate with someone else being present in my room(a very tiny room!). Also, my roommate and we have very different personalities and I don&apos;t think we are that much compatible. Soon after midterms, COVID 19 became pandemic in my country and soon colleges started closing down across the nation. Soon my institution also closed down and everybody went home. It was a happy moment for me because now I get to live in my own room,in my home with no one to intrude my privacy. This helped me to focus in my studies properly. Online classes led to less wastage of time and therefore I was able to use newly available time for daily workout. At the start of 2020, I resolved to become more fit and adopt a healthy lifestyle. I am happy that I have been somewhat successful in it. I reduced my weight by 32 kg and in the process also adopted a healthy lifestyle. My body feels very good now and also I feel more confident after losing weight. I fell in love with cardio and cardio helped me especially to lose a lot of weight. Regular cardio along with strict diet control led to weight loss in the span of one year. In this year, I learned a lot about my physical ability. At the start of the year, I was physcially very passive and I couldn&apos;t run 100 meters without getting out of my breath. But as I am writing this, I am able to run 10k in around 50 min,which I am hoping to improve more in 2021. My earlier excuse of asthma for not being able to run for long was BS and now I know asthma had nothing to do with that. It was just me being lazy and weak. Increasing my stamina and endurance also required a lot of mental strength which increased as my running distance increased. Thanks to David Goggnins, Joe Rogan and Lex Friedman, they inspired me to be more strong physically and mentally. I learned a lot about nutritional science too along the way to fitness and I keep learning new stuff. I feel like nutritional science is a very confusing subject as there are various contradictory results in this fields. So, many times I have to experiment it with my body to figure out if some food/diet helps my body in achieving the desired output or not. Healthy lifestyle also helped me to achieve a healthy mental state. Running helps me to distract my mind from depressing thoughts and prevents me from being sad. I definetly cried a lot less this year. But still occasionaly my mind goes into this depressed state but less than what it was before. I am still trying to figure out why it is happening with me. i haven&apos;t talked about it with anyone, mostly because I don&apos;t know how to talk about it. Is it a mental health issue or not? I don&apos;t know but it makes me miserable at times. I am hoping to improve my current mental health in 2021, so that I suffer less at times. This year, I realised I love to travel and explore new places. Travelling and visiting new places clearly cheer me up and make me happy.</p>
<p>This year, I got to learn a lot about how the real world works. Tbh,it is disappointing to some extent. From what I have observed and learned, most people are trying to sell horseshit to each other. Much of the world seems to be working like this. This has really disappointed me. I have lost respect for a lot of people this year whom I used to respect earlier. They all seem to be selling sugarcoated horseshit. Only a very few people are genuine and not trying to sell horseshit. I want to be one of those people. I learned to be more confident in myself now. People tend to be more unsupportive in nature in general and it is important to be more confident in yourself and do what you feel like is best for yourself. It is also important to work in silence and let the result make the noise. Thanks to David Goggins and Lex Friedman, I embrace suffering now. I believe now that suffering makes one more stronger and better.</p>
<p>Academically, this year was not that great for me. I had some inital setbacks at the start of the year and also my grades went down in the winter semester. I am hoping to get good grades in monsoon semester, especally because I worked hard in this semester, more than previous ones. I hope to make 2021 much better academically and will put my full focus in it in 2021. I have set some academic/career goals for 2021 and will try my best to achieve them. Monsoon semester was okayish. I learned a lot of new topics. Machine learning was the major one and it consumed most of my time too during the semester. Overall, ML seems to be math and statistics to me. But I still feel the hype around it is overrated. Theory of computation was a tough course and I learned a lot too, mostly by self studying. I hope to study more about it and go more in depth into the topic. Computer networks was good for first half of the semester but for the second half, it was bad and I lost interest, mostly because the way it was taught in second half was not suitable for me. Cloud computing course was interesting. Finally I understand what cloud computing is actually and not just simply a technological buzzword. I haven&apos;t done any significant project this year but I plan to be more active on that front in 2021. I have seen many people do exciting projects and I am inspired by them now. I have a lot of learning to do and I am excited about it. I feel like my CS knwoledge still has lot of loopholes in it and I want to cover them. I want to really understand computer stack from bottom to top. I plan to start learning the stack by first principle and fundamental learning from 2021. This is going to be exciting.</p>
<p>Overall, this year was okayish. It had it ups and downs. I got to connect with various new awesome online communities and I started to appreciate the power of internet more now. George Hotz streams and Lex Friedman podcast were very good these year. I spent a lot of time watching George Hotz programming/non-programming streams and he continues to inspire me. I mostly remember them because most of the time before going to sleep at night, I watch them :D. Now,only 2 days left for 2020 to be over. I am setting up this new personal blog now and a website to go along with it. I have gotten interested in chess for a few days now. For now, I suck at it but I plan to become good at it. That&apos;s it for this year review. I hope, next year turns out to be awesome for me and  I achieve everything I have planned to achieve.</p>
<p><em>2021 here I come!</em> :D</p>
