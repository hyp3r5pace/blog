# Introduction

**Hey there!**  
Welcome to this blog. This blog is a effort by me to organize my thoughts and work I am doing. I feel like documenting the things I learn, projects I do helps me to organize my work, effort and my thoughts. I intend to maintain this blog for a long time and have good quality posts. After much thought and blog pattern searching, I feel like gitbook is the best form of blogging for me because it will help me categorize my blog posts under various chapters. This will keep my blog clean and organized. I intend to play CTFs and wargames more rigorously from now on, so I will post my writeups in here from time to time. I am not a professional blogger, but I hope this blog will help me improve my writing skills and help me share my ideas with the good people of internet.  
  
If you find any mistakes in my blog, feel free to correct me. :D
